Chapter 1
    You wake up to your alarm only to realize you set it to 11am instead of 10.  Registration for HackTCNJ has just closed and you are across campus in your dorm wearing that same old pikachu t shirt from 8th grade.  Flying around your apartment trying to get ready, you only have time for one thing:
        Being presentable
            Damn you look good.  Strut your stuff as you run over to the Education building.
        remembering your phone charger
